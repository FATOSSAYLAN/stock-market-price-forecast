Project Proposal:
The research topic :
To predict the future prices of Vakko shares traded on the stock exchange using information such as
past prices, financial structure, financial balance sheet income statement, equity, raw material cost,
market data, macroeconomic data, textile sector analysis, fundamental analysis tools, demand supply
data, export and import data.
Intended data sources:
Financial Reports: The company's financial reports, such as the latest financial balance sheet and
income statement, provide us with important information about the company's financial situation, as
well as information about the company's profitability, debt level, equity capital structure and cash
flow.
Equity and Debt Structure: With the equity and debt structure of the company, its financial stability
and leverage ratio, these data enable us to understand the financial risk of the company.
Market Data: Data such as share prices, trading volume, and market capitalization are useful for
technical analysis. Examining past price movements allows us to predict future trends.
Sector and Industry Analysis: Data about the textile industry, such as industry reports, market trends,
and competitor performance, helps us understand the overall health and competitive position of the
industry.
Macroeconomic Indicators: Economic data, macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation
rates and exchange rates can affect the overall performance of the textile industry. Tracking this data
can help us evaluate overall economic conditions.
Company News and Events: Events such as important developments regarding the company, product
launches, strategic agreements or management changes may affect share prices.
Analyst Forecasts: Predictions and analyzes made by financial analysts about the future performance
of the company allow us to see the sentiment of investors.
Social and Sentiment Analysis: User comments and sentiment analysis on social media, financial
forums and news sites can help us gauge investors' perception of the company.
Reports and Research: Reports from independent financial analysis and research companies can
provide valuable insights into the company's future performance.
We can use regression analysis to base future performance on stock prices. In this analysis, we can
create a regression model using key factors that affect share prices (e.g. financial indicators, equity
structure, interest rates).
RNN model can be an artificial intelligence model that can be used for future prediction of stock
prices. RNN is a type of model that is particularly suitable for processing time series and capturing
relationships over time. Recurrent Neural Networks can be used to predict future data based on past
data. Moreover, the RNN model can also be used for sentiment analysis such as text data and news
analysis. In this way, we can evaluate the impact of important news and events about the company
on share prices.
Because LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Network) is a particularly effective method for processing
time series data and sequential data, we can create features based on historical time periods (for
example, previous days' stock prices).
